# Persisting Files in Azure Cloud Shell
Cloud Shell leverages Azure File storage to persist files across sessions.

## Setup clouddrive
On initial start, Cloud Shell prompts to associate a new or existing file share to persist files across sessions.

### Creating new storage
![](media/basic-storage.png)

When using basic settings and only selecting a subscription, three resources are created on your behalf in a supported region nearest to you:
1. Resource Group named: `cloud-shell-storage-<region>`
2. Storage Account named: `cs-uniqueGuid`
3. File Share named: `cs-<user>-<domain>-com-uniqueGuid`

This file share will mount as `clouddrive` under your $Home directory. This file share is also used to store a 5-GB image created for you that automatically updates and persists your $Home directory. This is a one-time action and automatically mounts for subsequent sessions.

### Use existing resources
![](media/advanced-storage.png)
An advanced option is also provided allowing you to associate an existing resources. When presented with the storage setup prompt, select "Show advanced settings" to see additional options. Existing file shares will receive a 5-GB user image to persist your $Home directory. Dropdowns are filtered for your assigned Cloud Shell region and locally/globally redundant storage accounts.

### Restrict resource creation with an Azure resource policy
Storage accounts created by Cloud Shell are tagged with `ms-resource-usage:azure-cloud-shell`. If you would like to disallow users from creating storage accounts through Cloud Shell, create an [Azure resource policy for tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-policy-tags) triggered by this specific tag.

## How it works
### Cloud Shell persists files with both methods below:
1. Create a disk image of your $Home directory to persist all contents within $Home. 
This disk image is saved in your specified file share as `acc_<User>.img` at `fileshare.storage.windows.net/fileshare/.cloudconsole/acc_<User>.img` and automatically syncs changes.

2. Mount your specified file share as `clouddrive` in your $Home directory for direct file share interaction. 
`/Home/<User>/clouddrive` is mapped to `fileshare.storage.windows.net/fileshare`.
 
> [!Note]
> All files in your $Home directory such as SSH keys are persisted in your user disk image stored in your mounted file share. Apply best practices when persisting information in your $Home directory and mounted file share.

## Using the clouddrive command
Cloud Shell allows users to run a command called `clouddrive` that enables manually updating the file share mounted to Cloud Shell.

## Mount a new clouddrive

### Pre-requisites for manual mounting
You may update the file share associated to Cloud Shell with the `clouddrive mount` command.

If mounting an existing file share, storage accounts must be:
1. LRS or GRS to support file shares.
2. Located in your assigned region. When onboarding, the region you are assigned to is listed in the resource group name `cloud-shell-storage-<region>`.

### Supported storage regions
Azure Files must reside in the same region as the Cloud Shell machine being mounted to. Cloud Shell machines exist in the following regions:
|Area|Region|
|---|---|
|Americas|East US, South Central US, West US|
|Europe|North Europe, West Europe|
|Asia Pacific|India Central, Southeast Asia|

### Mount command

> [!NOTE]
> If mounting a new file share, a new user image will be created for your $Home directory as your previous $Home image is held in the previous file share.

Run `clouddrive mount` with the following parameters <br>

```
clouddrive mount -s mySubscription -g myRG -n storageAccountName -f fileShareName
```

To see more details run `clouddrive mount -h`: <br>

## Unmount clouddrive
You may unmount a file share mounted to Cloud Shell at any time. However, Cloud Shell requires a mounted file share so you will be prompted to create and mount a new file share on next session if removed.

To remove a file share from Cloud Shell:
1. Run `clouddrive unmount`
2. Acknowledge and confirm prompts

Your file share will continue to exist unless manually deleted. Cloud Shell will no longer search for this file share on subsequent sessions.

To see more details run `clouddrive mount -h`: <br>
![](media/unmount-h.png)

> [!WARNING]
> This command will not delete any resources. However, manually deleting the resource group, storage account, or file share mapped to Cloud Shell will erase your $Home directory disk image and any files in your file share. This cannot be undone.

## List clouddrive
To discover which file share is mounted as `clouddrive`:

Run `df` 

The filepath to clouddrive will show your storage account name and file share in the url.

`//storageaccountname.file.core.windows.net/filesharename`

```

## Transfer local files to Cloud Shell
The `clouddrive` directory syncs to the Azure portal storage blade. Use this to transfer local files to or from your file share. Updating files from within Cloud Shell reflects in the File Storage GUI on blade refresh.

### Download files
![](media/download.png)
1. Navigate to the mounted file share
2. Select target file in Portal
3. Hit "Download"

### Upload files
![](media/upload.png)
1. Navigate to mounted file share
2. Select "Upload"
3. Select file you wish to upload
4. Confirm upload

You should now see the file accessible in your clouddrive directory in Cloud Shell.
